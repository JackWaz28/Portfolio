                    <p className="mt-5 divide-y-8 mb-5">Six other Virginia Tech Seniors and I seeked to build a synthetic tree, not only to replicate this natural process, 
                    but also to show its potential for practical applications, such as pumped-storage hydropower. This project built on a 10-foot tall synthetic tree project
                     completed the previous year, which proved that natural tree processes of transporting water upwards can be created synthetically. The next step towards
                      demonstrating the practicality of synthetic trees is to prove scalability; therefore, we created a 50-foot or taller synthetic tree, attached to and 
                      supported by a building. Since this is the largest synthetic tree ever built, the team had to solve unique design challenges, such as an initial tree 
                      saturation and construction of a new solar concentrator. We designed and built a solar concentrator to heat the leaf to increase the evaporation rate
                       at the top of the tree. We also create a two component charging system to distribute the water into the seven tubes and push the water up 50 feet. 
                       After the design was finalized, the team completed the build of the tree and performed testing during the Spring of 2021. Finally we wrote a final 
                       report outlining everything that we did throughout the year and what some of the next steps for the project could be. </p>
